## Principal Component Analysis
### Definition
Principal Component Analysis, or PCA, is a dimensionality-reduction method that is often used to reduce the dimensionality of large data sets, by transforming a large set of variables into a smaller one that still contains most of the information in the large set.

- PCA provides a normalisation that accounts for correlations between
features.
- PCA finds a change of basis for the data.
- The first principal component is the direction in which the variance is
highest.
